# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the Home page hero messaging and simplify the hero call-to-action to a single “Get started” link to the Plans page.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home page hero headline to “High Performance Game Servers” and the subheadline to “Experience lightning-fast performance, unbeatable reliability, and 24/7 support for all your favorite games.”
- Replace the existing “View Plans” and “Learn More” hero buttons with a single primary “Get started” button that navigates to `/plans` via the existing TanStack Router Link.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see updated hero text on the Home page and can click a single “Get started” button that takes them to the Plans page without a full page reload.
