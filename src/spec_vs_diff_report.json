  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented: a new Terms of Service page component was added under frontend/src/pages and a /tos route was added under the SiteLayout root; marketing navigation includes a new Terms of Service entry immediately after /payment and the diff summary indicates a footer link was also added. REQ-2 (Payment Method page CTA linking to /tos) cannot be confirmed from the provided truncated PaymentMethodPage diff section.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update the Payment Method page to provide a clear next-step navigation to the new TOS page (a prominent button/link after the payment-method content) using TanStack Router <Link>, without removing/breaking existing content.",
      "reason": "PaymentMethodPage.tsx is truncated before the end of the component; while it imports Link and Button (suggesting a CTA may have been added), the diff excerpt does not show an actual rendered CTA/button/link to /tos near the bottom, so implementation cannot be verified from the evidence provided.",
